**Productivity Tracker is a React app that helps you keep track of your time.**

# Description:
Productivity Tracker helps you keep track of your time by allowing you to set up goals for activities you want to accomplish during the day. The App first asks you
what time you want to work until, then it displays the elapsed and remaining time left during the day, which will be up to date even if you leave the page.
Afterwards, you are able to add an activity with a goal time. The activity displays the goal, elapsed and remaining time. If you leave the activity's timer running,
then close the page, it will display an up-to-date time when you visit the page again.
